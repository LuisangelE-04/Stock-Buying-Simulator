This program will simulate simple stock exchange by showing random prices only. 
Would like to implement an API that fetches real time stock values instead, but for testing purposes we will incorportate a random generator to test the stocks.

THe user will have a portfolio that shows the amount of stock they have, cash available and other features as well.

The purpose of this is to simulate buying stock and building your way up in the stock market virtually.

The timing will be quicker than real time in terms of when the program updates the price of the stock.
